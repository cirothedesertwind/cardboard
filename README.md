A Flexbox grid for use with Gesso.

You will need to complile the SASS file on your own currently. I use SassC on the commandline because it does not work with Netbeans just yet.

#### Acknowledgements

This grid was designed by [Kristofer Joseph](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid). I adapted the design to fit Gesso's AMCSS css style of using attributes and then condensed the original CSS using SASS.
